## What is this package for?

This JavaScript Library was privately developed and is still used by the Empo Inc. dev team. Since the beginning, our services have required a wide variety of encryption methods for each endpoint. This particular JavaScript cryptography library is more suitable for our services than other libraries are. The other libraries seem too complicated to understand and apply it to certain functions. Our library is optimized better and lightweight for fast development.
